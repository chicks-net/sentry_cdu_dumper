python version
--------------

The python version of the dumper script is currently mainly an effort for me to
learn python.  It lacks the features, such as command line options, that are
working in the Perl version.  The python version is also less buggy and faster
due to disabling the "more" pager within the Sentry interface.  This will be
integreated in the Perl version RSN.
